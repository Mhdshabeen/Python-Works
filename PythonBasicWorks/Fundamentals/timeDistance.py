# write a program to find the speed

#speed= distance/time

#read distance and time and print

distance=int(input("Enter distance in (m): "))

time=int(input("Enter time taken in (sec): "))

speed=distance/time

print(f"speed of object when disatace is {distance} and time taken is {time} ={speed} m/sec")


# m to km =>  m/1000

# km to m => km*1000

# sec to hr => sec/3600

# hr to sec => hr*3600
